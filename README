tkvideo - a Video Widget for the Tk Toolkit
-------------------------------------------

This project aims to provide a video display widget for the Tk toolkit
that can be used to display video data from files or from devices like
webcams or TV input.

At this time the widget only works for Windows. On this platform it
uses the DirectShow APIs to obtain and display video and so can
support any video sources supported by DirectX. This includes most
webcams and a number of common file types including AVI and WMV
files.

A related project is the QuickTimeTcl project which supports QuickTime
sources (.mov files, streaming video and some devices) on the Mac and
Windows.

INSTALLATION
------------

The tkvideo package is provided as source code or a pre-compiled zip
archive is available. A Tcl starkit version may also be available for
use with tclkit (http://equi4.com/tclkit.html).

To install the binary distribution you should locate your Tcl library
folder. This is available as the global variable tcl_library in a Tcl
shell. Unpack the zip archive in this folder and the package will be
available for use.

To compile the source code, you will require Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0,
a recent version of the Platform SDK and the DirectX SDK. Read the
comments in the file win/makefile.vc for additional details.

All files may be obtained from the project site at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tkvideo

Additionally the source code is maintained in a Subversion
repository. See http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=1738 for
information on connecting to this repository.
